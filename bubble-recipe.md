Ultimate bubble solution

from https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/physicists-determine-the-optimal-soap-recipe-for-blowing-gigantic-bubbles/

A perfect recipe
Ingredients
1 liter of water (about 2 pints)

50 milliliters of Dawn Professional Detergent (a little over 3 TBSP)

2-3 grams of guar powder, a food thickener (about 1/2 heaping TSP)

50 milliliters of rubbing alcohol (a little more than 3 TBSP)

2 grams of baking powder (about 1/2 TSP)

Directions

Mix the guar powder with the alcohol and stir until there are no clumps.

Combine the alcohol/guar slurry with the water and mix gently for 10 minutes. Let it sit for a bit so the guar hydrates. Then mix again. The water should thicken slightly, like thin soup or unset gelatin.

Add the baking powder and stir.

Add the Dawn Professional Detergent and stir gently, to avoid causing the mixture to foam.

Dip a giant bubble wand with a fibrous string into the mixture until it is fully immersed and slowly pull the string out. Wave the wand slowly or blow on it to create giant soap bubbles.
